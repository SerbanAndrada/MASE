                    A walk along the volcano of Nea Kameni
                </div>
                <p class="subheading mt-3">
                    Red and black rocks create a wild landscape around the
                    crater on Nea Kameni, a small island at the centre of the
                    caldera. From the top of a volcano with a 2.5 million-year
                    history, you have an incredible view of the caldera. The
                    myth that Santorini is the ancient city of Atlantis, which
                    submerged over 9,500 years ago, comes to life before your
                    eyes.

                    A spa in the Aegean Sea

                <p class="subheading mt-3">
                    If you don’t have a boat, you can easily rent one or hop on
                    a day cruise at Athinio, Gialos or Ammoudi, and take a tour
                    around the caldera. Discover the churches built into caves
                    and the old stairs used for mining excavations along the
                    cliffs. On the small island of Palia Kameni, if you dare,
                    you can dive into the thermal waters that form a volcanic
                    spa.

                    Holidays in the villages of the caldera are one of a kind,
                    with extraordinary cave-like houses grouped together in
                    volcanic soil. Enjoy a leisurely stroll from Fira to
                    Firostefani and Imerovigli. The more adventurous can
                    challenge themselves by taking the path to Oia, passing the
                    Prophet Elijah’s Church, the Chapel of the Cross and the
                    Black Mountain, which is iridescent at sunset, all of which
                    makes a walk that defies description.

                    Candle-lit terraces glimmer when the sun dips behind the
                    volcano. An intimate dinner for two, paired with a fine wine

                    ashes of the great volcanic eruption of 1600 B.C. Visit the
                    museum of Prehistoric Thera, at Fira, to admire its famous
